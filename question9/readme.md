Answer 9 HTML =>  

In HTML, tags and attributes are both fundamental components used to define the structure, behavior, and presentation of elements within an HTML document.
HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to mark the beginning and end of elements or to define standalone elements.
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and are usually written in lowercase.
Tags provide the structure and semantics to the content within an HTML document.
Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <img>, etc.


HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements.
Attributes are added within the opening tag of an HTML element.
Attributes are composed of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=).
Examples of HTML attributes include src, alt, href, class, style, id, etc.
Here are some examples of global attributes, which can be applied to most HTML elements:
    class: Specifies one or more class names to associate an element with a specific CSS class or classes.
Example: <div class="container">...</div>

id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, which can be used to target the element with CSS or JavaScript.
Example: <h1 id="page-title">Hello, World!</h1>

style: Defines inline CSS styles to apply to the element.
Example: <p style="color: red; font-size: 16px;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
     
     data-*: Allows custom data attributes to be added to elements for storing extra     information.
           Example: <div data-user-id="123">John Doe</div>

href: Specifies the URL or destination for a hyperlink.
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

These are just a few examples of global attributes in HTML. Each HTML element may also have specific attributes that are applicable only to that particular element, such as the src attribute for the <img> tag or the type attribute for the <input> tag.
