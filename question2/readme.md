Answer 2 HTML => 

 Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning and structure to the content within a web page. They go beyond the basic presentational tags (such as <div> and <span>) and offer descriptive names that convey the purpose or role of the content they enclose.
Here are some examples of semantic tags in HTML5:
<header>: Represents the introductory section or a container for the introductory content of a page or section.
<nav>: Defines a section of navigation links.
<main>: Represents the main content of the document.
<article>: Represents a self-contained composition, such as a blog post, article, or news story.
<section>: Represents a standalone section within a document.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, often displayed as a sidebar.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a document or a section.

The use of semantic tags is important for several reasons:
Clarity and Readability: Semantic tags provide a clear structure to the content, making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.
Accessibility: Semantic tags contribute to web accessibility by providing meaningful information to assistive technologies like screen readers. This improves the experience for users who rely on such technologies.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines use semantic tags to better understand the content and context of a web page. Proper use of semantic tags can improve the visibility and ranking of the page in search results.
