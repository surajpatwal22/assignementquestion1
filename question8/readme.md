Answer 8 HTML =>  

The <figure> tag and the <img> tag serve different purposes in HTML.
The <img> tag:
The <img> tag is a self-closing tag used to embed an image in an HTML document.
It does not require a closing tag and has attributes such as src, alt, width, and height.
The <img> tag is primarily used to display images on a web page.


The <figure> tag:
The <figure> tag is used to encapsulate any content that is referenced from the main content, typically an image or an illustration along with its caption.
It can contain one or more child elements, such as an image (<img>), a video, an audio file, or even a block of code.
The purpose of the <figure> tag is to provide a semantic structure to the content and indicate that it is a self-contained unit.
